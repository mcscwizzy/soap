# Soap 
Soap is a software that removes profanity/cussing from movies by using a subtitles file. It will replace any profanity in the subtitles with ***** and silence the audio in the movie. 

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
As of right now the only thing this app does is load an srt file, map it to a list of dictionaries, and finds profanity in that list. 
The next stage of this app will be to modify the srt file and replace the audio according to the timestamps. I work on this as I have time. No ETA at the moment.
